# Graph Challenge
As someone who wants to see how M&A activity effects management changes I want to import signals that have been derived from news content into a graph. Please take the signals below structured in a standardize XML format, and generate RDF files in an RDF format of your choosing. (You only need to model out 3 - 4 relationships.)

# XML Files
https://storage.cloud.google.com/pulsar-coding-challenge/DJManagementChange_M_20190201.zip  
https://storage.cloud.google.com/pulsar-coding-challenge/DJMergerAcquisition_M_20190201.zip 
(To download these files you will need to be logged into your Wizeline or Dow Jones Google Accounts.)
